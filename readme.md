# cc-config
Basic script meant to control symlinks for cc, c++, etc.
The aim for this script is to work with Clang, LLVM, GCC, and Binutils.

This is a very early script and has only basic error checking.

# TODO:
  - [ ] eselect module
  - [ ] c89 & c99 wrapper scripts?
    - gcc-config has these but i've never run into a package that used them
